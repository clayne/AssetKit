Features
================================================================================

* Very very small, very fast and flexible library
* Single interface for glTF 2.0 (with extensions), COLLADA 1.4/1.4.1/1.5, Wavefront Obj and others...
* Javascript-like API to get URL or ID `obj = ak_getObjectById(doc, objectId)`...
* Options to Generate Mesh Normals *(Default: enabled)*
* Option to Triangulate Polygons *(Default: enabled)*
* Option to change Coordinate System *(Default: enabled)*
* Option to calculate Bounding Boxes *(Default: enabled)*
* Unique and Flexible Coordinate System
  * Support multiple coordinate system
  * Can convert any coordinate system to another with adding transform or with changing transform, vertex data...
* Unique and Flexible Memory Management System 
    * Hierarchical unique memory management 
    * When a node is freed then all sub memories will be freed
    * COLLADA's **sid** and **ID** values are mapped to memory nodes itself to reduce memory size and make it easy to manage things.
    * Allow attach ID, sid or user data to a memory node
